To generate a single-dataset-style mturk evaluation package for NELL geolocations,

1) Place a copy of Locator-out.tsv in this folder (find it in latlongWorkingDir)
   Locator-out.tsv has the following fields:
       1 category:concept
       2 maxVarianceInMiles
       3 latVariance
       4 lonVariance
       5 lat
       6 lon
       7 count
       8 list of matched names

2) Run make.sh with the following arguments:
       1 dataset - give a name to your dataset, to distinguish these files from others
       2 Locator-out.tsv - as above
       3 minCategoryCount - only consider concepts from categories in Locator-out which have at least this many concepts listed
       4 maxVarInMiles - only consider geolocations in Locator-out which have this maxVar or less
       5 sampleSize - select this many random concepts from each category in Locator-out (should be equal or less than minCategoryCount)

3) Add a symlink to www/ from somewhere publicly browsable on the web. Make sure you have PHP turned on.

4) Generate gold data:
       a. Move www/save.safe.php to www/save.php
       b. Visit www/gold.html and do a few concepts in each category
       c. Move www/save.php to www/save.safe.php

5) Upload hitinput.txt to Mechanical Turk

6) Double check that the google links work

7) Run Mechanical Turk

8) Follow the directions in gal/README
